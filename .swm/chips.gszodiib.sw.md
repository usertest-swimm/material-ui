Hello everyone!

Today I'm going to be talking about Material-UI Chips. This is that little grey bubble component you see in the table. It's cool for implementing little status labels or wherever else to help your statuses or category type content stand out a little bit. As you can see these are all gray which is the default Chip component, but we're going to go and implement our own custom color Chips over that for our respective task statuses, which are for example: `completed`, `in progress` and `not started`. If you've ever used an app like Trello or Asana, this is what we're going for here.

Additionally we're going to implement a dropdown in the task dialog to allow the user to select the status from a dropdown to save that on the task.

You may notice this app template has changed a bit from my last update. I'm now focusing on building out a Task Tracker application in here which has a lot of great opportunities to talk Material UI and building apps in general. This will be part of a bigger project that I will launch in the future. You can download a [free version of this template here](https://react.school/material-ui/templates). Please subscribe to my Youtube if you enjoy this content.

And now, let's get started.
